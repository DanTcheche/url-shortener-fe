# url-shortener-fe
VueJS Frontend for url shortener.

### Setup

- Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and run `nvm use`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run serve`
- The project should run in port 8080 to avoid CORS related issues.


### Notes

If I had more time I would have created a backendService to make the posts and avoid code repetition.
I also would've created more components and divide the app better.
